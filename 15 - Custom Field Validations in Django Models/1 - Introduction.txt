This Custom Field Validations in Django Models revolves around how to add custom validation to a particular field. 

For example to add validation of an email to a CharField by specifying a particular format. 

There can be multiple ways on how to achieve custom validation. In this article, 
we are going to show it from the model itself so that you need not manipulate it elsewhere. 
These Validation are run when you are trying to create an instance of a model. 

Technically, this validation is implemented after you run ModelName.objects.create(data = data).

Syntax

field_name = models.Field(validators = [function 1, function 2])
